# Test Overview
I have to admit that this was a very interesting experience. I learned a lot during this test. I have never used handlebars.js, so I was very unfamiliar with the system and sintax of the code. However, it was fun learning about a new framework that I have never heard about before.

For changing the image with the mouse hover, it took some time in finding where was the asset that I was looking for, but looking through the manuals that they provided in the BigCommerce website I was able to come up with an idea on how to solve the problem. For this I just added one line so that when the hovering buttons came up in card.html the image would change as well with the selected second image, and it would go away when hovering away.

For the buttons problem, it took me a bit longer since I needed to get familiar with how the fetch API worked, I was familiar in making the XMLHttpRequest, but it was fun learning about sending the fetch to get information from the API. I also lost a bit of time in trying to make this work using just jquery because I haven't used that before, so I thought it could be great if I could make that work. Since I was spending too much time on it I decided to move on to different approach using fetch. Through a few hours of debugging and facepalms I was able to get both of the buttons to work. However, the toggle function still needs improving.
Overall I really want to thank you guys for this experience. It was really fun and even if I don't get the position this was fun, painful and edifying, just as engineering is meant to be. :D
